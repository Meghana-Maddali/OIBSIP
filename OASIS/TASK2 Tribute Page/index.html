        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC, better known as Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity.
        </p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Her family was of Albanian descent. At the age of twelve, she felt strongly the call of God. She knew she had to be a missionary to spread the love of Christ. At the age of eighteen she left her parental home in Skopje and joined the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions in India.
        </p>

        <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>
            Mother Teresa founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to the poor, particularly to those in India, that opened numerous centres serving the blind, the aged, and the disabled.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            She founded the Missionaries of Charity – a religious organization dedicated to helping the poor. Through this, she was able to create programs and initiatives that made her an icon of charity around the world. In the Catholic Church, she is also known as Saint Teresa after she was canonized by Pope Francis in 2016.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Mother Teresa was a multi dimensional figure, both simple and complex at the same time. Her faith, compassion and religion aside, Mother Teresa had all the qualities of a Manager – grit, determination and getting the odds to work for her. Her Management Model was “different”.
